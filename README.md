Course Project of SODV1201 (Rapid Application Development)

## Instructions

### Setup Credentials
To run the program, you will need to setup your credentials in a `.env` file.
To do this:
- Create a **copy** of `MovieDatabase/.env.template` and rename it to `MovieDatabase/.env`
- Fill up the `MovieDatabase/.env` with your own credentials (**don't use any quotation for strings**)
  Eg.
  ```
  OMDB_APIKEY=xxxxxxxx
  ```
